The customer will be advised of the monthly fee at the time of purchase. If the customer cancels the contract within 12 months they must return any hardware they have received, and pay the remaining balance of the 12 months contract. This is calculated by multiplying the number of months outstanding by the monthly fee. After 12 calendar months, the contract automatically becomes a rolling contract, with the monthly fee remaining the same. Either party can cancel the contract at any time, by giving 30 days notice. The Customer is at all times responsible for ensuring timely payments to avoid default charges. Incy will charge LKR 100 (ex vat) for each day that payment is overdue.
