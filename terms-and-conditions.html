                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Our hardware and software require a reliable and robust connection to the internet to take advantage of all of the online features and benefits.</li>
                  <li>It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that they have an appropriate internet connection in place prior to installation and to also ensure that the internet connection is maintained correctly.</li>
                  <li>Our recommended internet speeds are a minimum 7Mbps download speed and 0.6Mbps upload speed.</li>
                  <li>Internet speeds and consistencies can be checked by using internet speed test websites or contact your internet service provider. </li>

                  <li>Epos Now offers some services where we supply hardware and/or software solutions, without any upfront cost, but instead with a monthly fee. This includes, but isn't limited to, CCTV integration.</li>
                  <li>These services have a fee, which is charged monthly, with a minimum contract length of 12 calendar months.</li>
                  <li>The customer will be advised of the monthly fee at the time of purchase.</li>
                  <li>If the customer cancels the contract within 12 months they must return any hardware they have received, and pay the remaining balance of the 12 months contract. This is calculated by multiplying the number of months outstanding by the monthly fee.</li>
                  <li>After 12 calendar months, the contract automatically becomes a rolling contract, with the monthly fee remaining the same. Either party can cancel the contract at any time, by giving 30 days notice.</li>
                  <li>The Customer is at all times responsible for ensuring timely payments to avoid default charges. Epos Now will charge £10 (ex vat) for each day that payment is overdue.</li>
